# Deep-Learning

## What is Deep Learning?
From the beginning when we learn math we are learning functions. For a straight line, it can be f(x) = x +3. When the input x = 3, it is quite easy to get f(3) = 6.
If the input is an audio, you need to simulate something similar to a function. The function would output the content of the input audio. f(~~~~) = "Hello World"
