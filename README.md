# Deep-Learning

## What is Machine Learning?
From the beginning when we learn math we are learning functions. For a straight line, it can be f(x) = x +3. When the input x = 3, it is quite easy to get f(3) = 6.

If the input is an audio, you need to simulate something similar to a function. The function would output the content of the input audio.
**f(![image](https://github.com/mattliu777/Deep-Learning/blob/master/image/audioicon_e4_rel.jpg)) = "Hello World"**

If the input is a picture, you want to simulate a complex function so that its output is what this picture is.
**f() = "Cat"**

If the input is a Go board, you want to simulate a complex function and let it tell you where to go next.
**f() = "1-2"**
